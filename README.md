# kickzig "zig and dvui my way"

## Sep 5, 2023

kickzig is a code generator that will create my application framework in zig using the excellent dvui gui.

kickzig will only do 3 things.

1. Creates it's application framework code in a folder with a zig.mod file.
1. Adds to and removes from the framework GUI a little or a lot at a time.
1. Adds and removes messages and message handlers in the framework.

All zig files generated by kickzig, which require or allow edits, contain simple instructions at **KICKZIG TODO** comments. A search of the source code for **KICKZIG TODO**, anytime after running a **kickzig** command, will reveal clear instructions about what can or must be done.

## Project summary

I'm learning zig as I build this tool and my okp app.

This is version 0.0.0. I'm slowly figuring out how to rewrite this in zig. Some of the kickfyne's GO source code in included for me to reference.
