## fn kickStart() !void

The back-end code begins at **src/@This/backend/api.zig. The file contains a fn kickStart() which starts the back-end after the front-end is up and running.

I want the app's contact list to load when the app starts so it happens in the only line I added.

* line 17. gave functionality to fn kickStart().
